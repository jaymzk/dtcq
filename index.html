      <input type="text" placeholder="Patient Reference" name="patient-details" maxLength="40">
    </form>

  <p id="intro">Listed below are some situations or events in which people might drink or use drugs.
    Imagine yourself right now in each of these situations.
    Indicate on the scale provided how confident you are that you would be able to resist the urge
    to drink or use drugs in that situation.</p>
  <p id="instructions">Click 100 if if you are 100% confident right now that you could resist the urge to drink or use drugs;
    80 if you 80% confident; 60 if you are 60% confident. <br><br>
    If you're more unconfident than confident, choose 40 to indicate that
    you're only 40% confident that you could resist the urge to use drink or use, or 20 for 20% confidence.
    Choose zero if you have no confidence at all about that situation.</p>
